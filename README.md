## Dog-Breed-Classifier
# Figure out what kind of dog your dog - and your friends - really are

This project is classifier that predicts the breed of a dog based on a picture. This was built using CNN transfer learning as a project for the Udacity Deep learning Nanodegree.

## What You Need to Get Started
### First, you can check out my code [here](https://github.com/jsreddy3/Dog-Breed-Classifier/blob/master/dog_app_prediction.ipynb).
###Next, I would check out [this link](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification) and follow the recommendations and instructions on how this all works.

## Prerequisite Files and Structures
#### First, you need a Jupyter Notebook. I do all my code through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).
#### Next, you need a GPU or a CPU. I highly recommend a GPU; if you're following along with the Udacity Nanodegree there should be one available.
#### Next, you're going to need the files. Go to the recommendations and instructions I attached in the "What You Need to Get Started" Section; I would use 7zip to download the dog and human datasets, as explained by @udacity.
#### You also need PyTorch and its corresponding libraries. You can check out some installation instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)
#### A portion of the project uses a face detector. You can find that on [this Kaggle site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/). For some reason this does not seem to work unless you have created your own Kaggle account (free).
